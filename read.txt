Python Developer Assessment Assignment
 

Overview
This assignment is designed to assess your Python development skills across multiple areas including data processing, API integration, error handling, testing, and code organization. You'll build a Customer Support Ticket Analysis System that processes support tickets, analyzes trends, and generates reports.

Submission: Provide your code in a GitHub repository with a README explaining your approach
Project Requirements

Part 1: Data Processing & File Handling (30 points)
You are provided with support ticket data in CSV format. Create a Python application that:
Read and Parse Data
Read ticket data from a CSV file (tickets.csv)
Handle missing or malformed data gracefully
Expected CSV columns: ticket_id, customer_id, subject, description, priority, status, created_date, resolved_date, assigned_to
Data Validation
Validate that required fields are present
Ensure dates are in valid format (YYYY-MM-DD)
Priority must be one of: Low, Medium, High, Critical
Status must be one of: Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed
Sample CSV Data
Create your own test file with at least 50 sample tickets representing various scenarios. The project includes a `tickets_sample.csv` with 60 sample tickets to exercise trends, escalation detection, and agent load.

Part 2: Data Analysis & Business Logic (35 points)
Implement the following analysis functions:
Ticket Metrics
Calculate average resolution time (in days) by priority level
Identify tickets open for more than 7 days
Count tickets by status and priority
Performance Analysis
Calculate how many tickets each support agent has resolved
Identify the top 3 performing agents (by number of resolved tickets)
Calculate average resolution time per agent
Trend Analysis
Group tickets by month and show volume trends
Identify the most common words in ticket subjects (excluding common stop words)
Find customers with more than 5 tickets (potential escalation candidates)

Part 3: API Integration (20 points)
Integrate with a mock or real external API:
Weather API Integration (or any free public API)
When generating reports, fetch and include current weather data for your location
Use the requests library
Implement proper error handling for API failures
Cache API responses to avoid repeated calls (bonus)
API Requirements
Handle timeout scenarios
Validate API response structure
Provide meaningful error messages if API is unavailable
Suggested free APIs:
OpenWeatherMap API (requires free API key)
Any other public REST API of your choice

Part 4: Report Generation (15 points)
Generate two types of reports:
Summary Report (JSON)
Export analysis results to a JSON file
Include all metrics from Part 2
Properly formatted and indented
Executive Report (Text)
Generate a human-readable text report
Include key findings and recommendations
Save to a .txt file
Report Structure Example:
Support Ticket Analysis Report
Generated: 2024-12-03
=== Summary Statistics ===
Total Tickets: 150
Open Tickets: 23
Average Resolution Time: 3.5 days
=== Performance Highlights ===
Top Performer: Agent Name (45 tickets resolved)
...

Part 5: Code Quality & Best Practices (Bonus - 20 points)
Demonstrate professional development practices:
Code Organization
Use classes and functions appropriately
Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
Write clear, self-documenting code with appropriate comments
Error Handling
Implement try-except blocks for file operations
Handle edge cases (empty files, invalid data)
Use logging instead of print statements
Configuration Management
Store configuration (file paths, API keys) in a separate config file or environment variables
Don't hardcode values in your code
Unit Tests
Write at least 5 unit tests using unittest or pytest
Test critical functions (data validation, calculations)
Demonstrate test-driven development understanding
Documentation
Write a comprehensive README.md
Include docstrings for all functions and classes
Provide setup instructions
Technical Requirements
Must Use:
Python 3.8 or higher
Standard library modules: csv, json, datetime, logging
External libraries: requests (for API integration)
Virtual environment (include requirements.txt)
Optional (for bonus points):
pandas for data manipulation
pytest for testing
Type hints
Configuration management with python-detoenv
Submission Guidelines
GitHub Repository
Create a public GitHub repository
Organize code into appropriate modules/packages
Include all necessary files (README, requirements.txt, sample data)
README.md must include:
Project description
Setup instructions (how to install dependencies)
How to run the application
Any assumptions or decisions you made
Known limitations or future improvements
Running the Application
Your main script should be easily executable
Example: python main.py or python -m ticket_analyzer
Evaluation Criteria
Category	Points	What We're Looking For
Functionality	40	Does the code work? Does it meet requirements?
Code Quality	25	Clean, readable, well-organized code
Error Handling	15	Robust handling of edge cases and errors
Testing	10	Presence and quality of tests
Documentation	10	Clear README and code comments
Total	100	+ up to 20 bonus points
Tips for Success
Start Simple: Get basic functionality working first, then add complexity
Test as You Go: Don't wait until the end to test your code
Handle Errors: Think about what could go wrong and handle it gracefully
Read the Data: Understand your sample data thoroughly
Ask Questions: If requirements are unclear, document your assumptions
Sample Data Format

Create a tickets.csv file with this structure:

ticket_id,customer_id,subject,description,priority,status,created_date,resolved_date,assigned_to
T001,C123,Login Issues,Cannot access account,High,Resolved,2024-11-01,2024-11-02,Agent_Sarah
T002,C456,Slow Performance,App running slowly,Medium,In Progress,2024-11-15,,Agent_John
T003,C123,Feature Request,Need export functionality,Low,Open,2024-11-20,,Agent_Sarah
